**Storeways** is an open‑source, modular e‑commerce platform. It gives you full control over the stack — from backend APIs to storefront and admin.

- **Monorepo** managed with `pnpm`
- **Server**: Node.js + Express
- **Client**: Next.js storefront
- **Admin**: React dashboard
- **Pluginable**: storage, payments, and more

If you're new here, start with Getting Started, then learn the Architecture, and pick the app you want to work on (Server, Client, or Admin).
